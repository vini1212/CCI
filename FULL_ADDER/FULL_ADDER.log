*** 13 WARNING MESSAGES GENERATED DURING SETUP

Warning : Newton solver has failed due to extremely large node voltages.
        : If the circuit has very high gain and extremely large voltages (>1000V) are expected,
        : then you may use '.option vmax=0' to disable this check.
Conventional DC operating point computation failed.
Gmin stepping failed
Final gmin value = 1e-012, dcstep = 0
Source stepping succeeded
Fatal Error : Transient simulation failed: time step too small
            : Final time = 6.26086e-014, failed timestep = 1e-018
            : The Newton solver did not converge in 10 iterations
            : You may be able to correct this problem if you:
            : 	- increase the value of the numnt option (maximum number of Newton solver iterations)
            : 	- increase the value of the reltol (aka reli) option (0.0005)
            : 	- increase the value of the abstol (aka absi) option (1e-010)
            : 	- ensure that transistor parasitics are in place, to smooth out discontinuities
            : 	- increase the rise and fall times of piecewise linear and pulse sources
            : 	- reduce the timestep, or switch to method=BDF, if there are wild voltage oscillations
